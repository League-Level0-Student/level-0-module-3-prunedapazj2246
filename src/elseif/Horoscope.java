You've never missed a deadline, so you know that one way or another you will get everything done. In the meantime, begin to make plans for your next getaway. Plaster your office with photos of exotic locations to satisfy your wanderlust for the time being.");

Your thoughts are on your evening and weekend activities, but your obligations are on your desk. Don't despair. Simply make a commitment to do what's expected of you. Enjoy yourself this evening, secure in the knowledge that you've fulfilled your obligations.");

Your system at home, such as it is, isn't particularly efficient. Your bill paying is haphazard, and you may be surprised by how much you pay in late fees. Your in-box threatens to bury you. You need a system, Gemini! If this isn't your strong suit, hire some help.");

You risk offending people if you expound on them. You'd be better off keeping your views to yourself. In fact, rather than try to change people's minds with words, why not try and do it with actions? Set the right example. It's often a more effective form of persuasion.");

Rather than take the easy route and say yes, you and your friend would be better served if you helped him or her figure out a way to earn the money.
